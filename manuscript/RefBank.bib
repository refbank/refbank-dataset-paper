  abstract = {Conversational partners who repeatedly refer to the same objects require less and less collaborative effort to do so. This is due to lexical entrainment, the fact that they come to re-use the same words. Lexical entrainment may reflect the elaboration of conceptual pacts, partner-specific agreements about how to name objects which belong to the conversational partners' common ground. Can lexical entrainment occur even if conversational partners cannot develop conceptual pacts about specific objects? In three experiments, we investigated whether lexical entrainment occurs in the matching task even when cards change over trials and partners are not able to develop pacts. We compared two conditions: a classic condition where cards remained the same for each trial, and a new cards condition where cards changed on each trial. Lexical diversity decreased for pairs in the new cards condition (albeit less than for classical pairs); inconsistent reductions in collaborative effort were also observed. Pairs in the new cards condition also were better able to adapt to novel referring situations (involving novel stimuli or new interaction partners) than classic pairs. The results suggest that lexical entrainment in the matching task may be due in part to factors other than the elaboration of conceptual pacts. These may include the development of an overarching meta-perspective on shared features of cards, reflecting category learning processes resulting from reference negotiation.},

  abstract = {A drive towards efficiency seems to regulate communicative processes and ultimately language change. In line with efficiency principles, signed, spoken, and/or gestural utterances tend to reduce in overall effort over repeated referrals in referential tasks. Although theories generally assume multimodality and interaction, this process has mostly been operationalized as individual effort in a single communicative modality. Here we seek to understand reduction of communicative effort in its natural environment, i.e. during multimodal and collaborative face-to-face dialogues about displaced referents. We ascertain that the reduction in joint effort (y) over repeated referrals (x) follows a negative power relationship, y~=~a*x{\textasciicircum}c, where a and c are constants. This reduction in communicative effort is multimodal, occurring across gesture, speech, prosody, and turn taking, and it is interactive, based on joint effort. The pattern is robust, being confirmed through reanalyses of published datasets about (individual) effort reduction. Crucially, the pattern is communicatively relevant. The coefficient of the power relationship predicts change and convergence in interlocutors' conceptualizations of the communicative referents over the interaction. The negative power relationship reflects therefore how effort translates into mutual understanding - a process we call communicative work. We suggest that the power function captures an exploration-exploitation trade-off during human dialogue which emerges from multiscale processes. Joint conceptualization of novel referents benefits from early conceptual exploration followed by later exploitation of selected signals. The current report proposes a novel `power law of joint communicative work' that is relevant for linguistic theory, agent-based modeling, and experimental psychology.},

As the audience size grows, interlocutors face new challenges that do not arise in dyads. They must consider multiple perspectives and weigh multiple sources of feedback to build shared understanding. Here, we ask which properties of the group's interaction structure facilitate successful communication. We used a repeated reference game paradigm in which directors instructed between one and five matchers to choose specific targets out of a set of abstract figures. Across 313 games (               N               = 1,319 participants), we manipulated several key constraints on the group's interaction, including the amount of feedback that matchers could give to directors and the availability of peer interaction between matchers. Across groups of different sizes and interaction constraints, describers produced increasingly efficient utterances and matchers made increasingly accurate selections. Critically, however, we found that smaller groups and groups with less-constrained interaction structures (``thick channels'') showed stronger convergence to group-specific conventions than large groups with constrained interaction structures (``thin channels''), which struggled with convention formation. Overall, these results shed light on the core structural factors that enable communication to thrive in larger groups.},

Such knowledge can be accumulated through linguistic and non-linguistic context, but the same context can be associated with different patterns of knowledge, depending on the interlocutor's participant role (Wilkes-Gibbs and Clark, 1992). Although there is substantial evidence that children's ability to model partners' knowledge develops gradually, most such evidence focuses on non-linguistic context. We investigated the extent to which 8- to 10-year-old children can assess common ground developed through prior linguistic context, and whether this is sensitive to variations in participant role. Children repeatedly described tangram figures to another child, and then described the same figures to a third child who had been a side-participant, an overhearer, or absent during the initial conversation. Children showed evidence of partner modeling, producing shorter referential expressions with repeated mention to the same partner. Moreover, they demonstrated sensitivity to differences in common ground with the third child based on participant role on some but not all measures (e.g., description length, but not definiteness). Our results suggest that by ten, children make distinctions about common ground accumulated through prior linguistic context but do not yet consistently deploy this knowledge in an adult-like way.},

Pairs of participants received an identical set of cards, each card displaying a geometric configuration (a ``tangram'').

Directors sometimes included a hedge in their description of a tangram (e.g., ``looks kinda like an eagle''), and more so the first time than on subsequent mentions. The present study tested the hypothesis that, by revealing their uncertainty regarding the adequacy of their description in conveying the intended meaning, directors signal a possible difficulty in establishing reference. This in turn prompts their addressee to display, rather than merely assert, their understanding (by presenting a description for the tangram the matcher believes the director is referring to, for the director to evaluate). Analyses of matchers' responses to descriptions that directors had hedged or not confirmed the hypothesis. This finding supports the view that conversational partners work together to reach the mutual belief that they have coordinated what the speaker means and what their addressee takes them to mean. Conversational partners expend more joint effort when they deem the risk of misunderstanding to be high than when it is perceived to be low.},

This claim was examined in a corpus with large variability in matchers' referential accuracy. Analysis of the matcher's choices of referent on each trial revealed that their director's propensity to include a hedge in their descriptions over the course of the task was a significant predictor of the matcher's success at the task.

Language offers a community a system of conventions for recurrent coordination problems. Furthermore, research on repeated reference involving novel and hard-to-name shapes has claimed that an initial reference sets up a precedent, a partner-specific perspective that can be used subsequently. In a referential communication task involving photos of everyday objects, the present study hypothesized that precedents are temporary solutions developed by conversational partners when community-wide conventions on how to refer to the entity are not readily available. Degree of accessibility to conventions for each object (i.e., the object's name uncertainty) was quantified based on the distribution of words used by all participants to talk about the object for the first time. Results from two studies showed that for objects with low name uncertainty, the expressions used by a dyad on two consecutives mentions were no more similar to each other than to expressions used by other dyads, suggesting reliance to community-wide conventions. For objects with greater name uncertainty, however, a given dyad's expressions produced on two successive mentions resembled each other more than they resembled other dyads' expressions. Finally, the usage of bare nominals (vs. definite or indefinite noun phrases) to refer to an object on second mention decreased as the object's name uncertainty increased, a finding that further supports the claim that conversational partners rely on precedents as temporary solutions to compensate for uncertain availability of community-wide conventions.},

However, another axis of generalization remains understudied: how do conventions formed for one target transfer to completely distinct targets, when specific lexical choices are unlikely to repeat? This paper presents two dyadic studies (N = 240) that address this axis of generalization, focusing on the role of nameability -- the a priori likelihood that two individuals will share the same label. We leverage the recently-released KiloGram dataset, a collection of abstract tangram images that is orders of magnitude larger than previously available, exhibiting high diversity of properties like nameability. Our first study asks how nameability shapes convention formation, while the second asks how new conventions generalize to entirely new targets of reference. Our results raise new questions about how ad hoc conventions extend beyond target-specific re-use of specific lexical choices.},

We find that different pairs discover a wide variety of idiosyncratic but efficient and stable solutions to the problem of reference. Furthermore, these conventions are shaped by the communicative context: words that are more discriminative in the initial context (i.e. that are used for one target more than others) are more likely to persist through the final repetition. Finally, we find systematic structure in how a speaker's referring expressions become more efficient over time: syntactic units drop out in clusters following positive feedback from the listener, eventually leaving short labels containing open-class parts of speech. These findings provide a higher resolution look at the quantitative dynamics of ad hoc convention formation and support further development of computational models of learning in communication.},

Yet, language use in a variable and nonstationary social environment requires linguistic representations to be flexible: Old words acquire new ad hoc or partner-specific meanings on the fly. In this article, we introduce continual hierarchical adaptation through inference (CHAI), a hierarchical Bayesian theory of coordination and convention formation that aims to reconcile the long-standing tension between these two basic observations. We argue that the central computational problem of communication is not simply transmission, as in classical formulations, but continual learning and adaptation over multiple timescales. Partner-specific common ground quickly emerges from social inferences within dyadic interactions, while community-wide social conventions are stable priors that have been abstracted away from interactions with multiple partners. We present new empirical data alongside simulations showing how our model provides a computational foundation for several phenomena that have posed a challenge for previous accounts: (a) the convergence to more efficient referring expressions across repeated interaction with the same partner, (b) the gradual transfer of partner-specific common ground to strangers, and (c) the influence of communicative context on which conventions eventually form.},

To explain the emergence of compositionality, researchers have appealed to functional pressures from communication. However, languages may merely inherit the component structure found in the environment. We designed a reference game to explicitly disentangle these possibilities; pairs of participants (N = 450) communicated about about sets of shapes that were assembled from component parts. Critically, we manipulated whether shapes that shared the same parts were competitors within each trial or were distributed across different trials. We found that participants successfully developed efficient conventions for referring to the shapes. However, participants who needed to distinguish shapes that shared components within the same context were more likely to develop compositional systems. When shared components appeared in separate contexts, participants favored non-compositional conventions. These results suggest compositional language structure most readily emerges from immediate communicative pressures rather than environmental structure alone.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that speakers will depart from an Aim Low approach in order to efficiently communicate with larger groups of interacting partners. Further, we ask whether the cognitive demands of tracking multiple conversational partners' perspectives places limitations on successful audience design. We find that speakers can successfully track information about what up to four of their partners do and do not know in conversation. When addressing groups of 3--4 addressees at once, speakers design language based on the combined knowledge of the group. These findings point to an audience design process that simultaneously represents the perspectives of multiple other individuals and combines these representations in order to design utterances that strike a balance between the different needs of the individuals within the group.},
